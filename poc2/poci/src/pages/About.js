      As one of the oldest and perhaps most underrated liquors in existence, 
      gin presents an interesting challenge to first-time drinkers. This botanical booze
      doesn't often become someone's drink of choice until long after their experimental
      teen and young adult years. With so few popular college cocktails sweeping campuses 
      with gin as their base, many people don't learn how to drink gin when they're first 
      taste testing everything that they can get their hands on. So, if you've been straying 
      away from trying gin because you're not quite sure where to even start, let this 
      helpful guide break the junipery ingredient down for you.
